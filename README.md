This Is Infinite Campus
A Hopefully Unblocked Website That Allows You To Play Games, Browse The Web, And Much More.

WARNING:
If You Fork This Repo And Try To Run It, The Games And The Proxy Will Not Work
This Is Because This Repo Is Only The Public Folder For The Infinite Campus Server And Since The Proxy And Games Try To Contact The Proxy, They Will Fail If The Files Are Not There.
Unfortunately, I Cannot Put The Whole Server Setup On Here As It Would Expose My Discord Bot Token. And Even If I Removed It, It Still Wouldnt Be Able To Upload Here Because It Requires Lots More Secial Tokens And Secrets.
If You Are Trying To Download The Website And Trying To Use It Without The Proxy, Please Refer To Commit eb6d827(81) Or Go To This Url And Click The Code Icon And Select Download Zip File
